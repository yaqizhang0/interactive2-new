		by Edgar Allan Poe<br>
<p>Take this kiss upon the brow!<br></p>
<p>And, in parting from you now,<br>
Thus much let me avow--<br>
You are not wrong, who deem<br>
<p>That my days have been a dream;<br></p>
<p>Yet if hope has flown away<br>
In a night, or in a day,<br>
In a vision, or in none,<br>
Is it therefore the less gone?<br>
All that we see or seem<br>
<p>Is but a dream within a dream.<br>
</p>

<p>I stand amid the roar<br>
Of a surf-tormented shore,<br>
And I hold within my hand<br>
Grains of the golden sand--<br>
How few! yet how they creep<br>
Through my fingers to the deep,<br>
While I weep--while I weep!<br>
<p>O God! can I not grasp<br></p>
<p>Them with a tighter clasp?<br>
<p>O God! can I not save<br></p>
<p>One from the pitiless wave?<br>
Is all that we see or seem<br>
But a dream within a dream?</p>
